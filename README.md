## üéØ Overview

This tool enables security analysts and incident responders to quickly capture network traffic on remote Windows endpoints through Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's Live Response feature. It leverages the built-in Windows Packet Monitor (Pktmon) utility to capture packets and automatically converts them to PCAP format for analysis in Wireshark or other network analysis tools.

### Why This Tool?

During incident response, you often need to:
- Capture network traffic on compromised endpoints without installing additional software
- Quickly gather network evidence during active incidents
- Filter traffic to specific IPs or ports to reduce noise
- Retrieve packet captures remotely without direct endpoint access

This script solves these challenges by providing a simple, parameter-driven interface to Pktmon that works seamlessly with Defender Live Response.

## ‚ú® Features

- **üîç Flexible Filtering**: Capture all traffic or filter by specific IP addresses and/or ports
- **‚è±Ô∏è Configurable Duration**: Choose between 1, 5, or 15-minute capture windows
- **üì¶ Full Packet Capture**: Captures complete packets, not just headers (using `--pkt-size 0`)
- **üîÑ Automatic Conversion**: Converts native ETL format to PCAP for Wireshark compatibility
- **üìä Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress indicators during capture
- **üßπ Auto-cleanup**: Automatically removes filters after capture
- **üìù Detailed Logging**: Comprehensive status messages for troubleshooting

## üìã Requirements

### Endpoint Requirements
- **Windows Version**: Windows 10 1809+ or Windows Server 2019+
- **Pktmon**: Built into Windows (no installation required)
- **Permissions**: Administrative privileges (automatically handled by Live Response)

### Management Requirements
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint**: E5 or standalone license
- **Live Response**: Enabled in Defender settings
- **Permissions**: Security Administrator or Global Administrator role

## üöÄ Installation

### Step 1: Download the Script
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/defender-live-response-pcap.git

# Or download directly
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/defender-live-response-pcap/main/LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1
```

### Step 2: Upload to Defender Live Response Library

1. Sign in to [Microsoft 365 Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **Endpoints** ‚Üí **Response** ‚Üí **Live response scripts**
3. Click **Upload file**
4. Select `LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1`
5. Add a description (optional)
6. Click **Submit**

## üíª Usage

### Basic Syntax

```powershell
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 [-TargetIP <string>] [-TargetPort <int>] [-Duration <int>]
```

### Starting a Live Response Session

1. In Microsoft 365 Defender portal, go to **Devices**
2. Select the target device
3. Click **Initiate Live Response Session**
4. Wait for the session to establish
5. Run the packet capture script with desired parameters

## üìù Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `-TargetIP` | String | No | None | Filter capture to traffic to/from this IP address |
| `-TargetPort` | Integer | No | None | Filter capture to traffic on this port |
| `-Duration` | Integer | No | 60 | Capture duration in seconds (60, 300, or 900) |

## üìö Examples

### Example 1: Basic Capture
Capture all network traffic for 60 seconds:
```powershell
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1
```

### Example 2: IP-Specific Capture
Capture traffic to/from a specific IP for 5 minutes:
```powershell
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 -TargetIP "192.168.1.100" -Duration 300
```

### Example 3: Port-Specific Capture
Capture all HTTPS traffic (port 443) for 15 minutes:
```powershell
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 -TargetPort 443 -Duration 900
```

### Example 4: Combined Filters
Capture SMB traffic to a specific server:
```powershell
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 -TargetIP "10.0.0.5" -TargetPort 445 -Duration 300
```

### Example 5: Incident Response Workflow
```powershell
# 1. Start Live Response session
# 2. Run quick 1-minute capture to identify suspicious connections
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 -Duration 60

# 3. Review results, then capture specific suspicious IP
run LiveResponse-PacketCapture.ps1 -TargetIP "185.220.101.45" -Duration 300

# 4. Retrieve the PCAP file
getfile "IR_Capture_20241120_143022.pcap"
```

## üìÅ Output Files

The script generates two files:

| File | Format | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `IR_Capture_[timestamp].pcap` | PCAP | Wireshark-compatible packet capture |
| `IR_Capture_[timestamp].etl` | ETL | Original Windows Event Trace Log |

**Timestamp Format**: `yyyyMMdd_HHmmss` (e.g., `20241120_143022`)

### Retrieving Files

After the capture completes, use the Live Response `getfile` command:

```powershell
# Retrieve PCAP file for analysis
getfile "IR_Capture_20241120_143022.pcap"

# Optionally retrieve ETL file
getfile "IR_Capture_20241120_143022.etl"
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Failed to start packet capture"
**Solution**: Ensure the Live Response session has administrative privileges (should be automatic).

#### Issue: "Failed to convert to PCAP format"
**Solution**: The ETL file is still available. You can:
1. Retrieve the ETL file and convert locally
2. Use Microsoft Network Monitor to analyze ETL files
3. Convert manually: `pktmon etl2pcap file.etl --out file.pcap`

#### Issue: No packets captured
**Possible Causes**:
- Filters too restrictive
- No network activity during capture
- Network adapter issues

**Solution**: Try capturing without filters first

### Useful Commands

```powershell
# Check if Pktmon is available
pktmon help

# List network adapters
pktmon list

# Check for existing filters (run locally)
pktmon filter list

# Manual cleanup if needed
pktmon stop
pktmon filter remove
```
